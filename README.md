## About

The goal of the appc package is to provide daily, high resolution, near
real-time, model-based ambient air pollution exposure assessments. This
is achieved by training a generalized random forest on several
geomarkers to predict daily average EPA AQS concentrations from 2017
until the present at exact locations across the contiguous United States
(see `vignette("cv-model-performance")` for more details). The appc
package contains functions for generating geomarker predictors and the
ambient air pollution concentrations. Predictor geomarkers include
weather and atmospheric information, wildfire smoke plumes, elevation,
and satellite-based aerosol diagnostics products. Source files included
with the package train and evaluate models that can be updated with any
release to use more recent AQS measurements and/or geomarker predictors.

## Installing

Install the latest stable release of appc from R-universe with:

``` r
install.packages("appc", repos = c("https://geomarker-io.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Install the latest, under-development version of appc from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("geomarker-io/appc")
```

## Example

In R, create model-based predictions of ambient air pollution
concentrations at exact locations on specific dates using the
`predict_pm25()` function:

``` r
appc::predict_pm25(
  x = s2::as_s2_cell(c("8841b39a7c46e25f", "8841a45555555555")),
  dates = list(as.Date(c("2024-05-18", "2024-06-10")), as.Date(c("2023-06-22", "2023-08-15")))
)

## S2 Geometry

The [S2Geometry](https://s2geometry.io/) library is a
[hierarchical](https://s2geometry.io/devguide/s2cell_hierarchy.html)
geospatial index that uses [spherical
geometry](https://s2geometry.io/about/overview). The appc package uses
s2 cells via the [s2](https://r-spatial.github.io/s2/) package to
specify geospatial locations. In R, s2 cells can be
[created](https://r-spatial.github.io/s2/reference/s2_cell.html#ref-examples)
using their character string representation, or by specifying latitude
and longitude coordinates; e.g.:

``` r
s2::s2_lnglat(c(-84.4126, -84.5036), c(39.1582, 39.2875)) |> s2::as_s2_cell()
#> <s2_cell[2]>
#> [1] 8841ad122d9774a7 88404ebdac3ea7d1
```

## Geomarker Assessment

Spatiotemporal geomarkers are used for predicting air pollution
concentrations, but also serve as exposures or confounding exposures
themselves. View information and options about each geomarker:

| geomarker | appc function |
|----|----|
| üå¶ weather & atmospheric conditions | `get_gridmet_data()`, `get_narr_data()` |
| üõ∞ satellite-based aerosol diagnostics | `get_merra_data()` |
| üî• wildfire smoke | `get_hms_smoke_data()` |
| üóª elevation | `get_elevation_summary()` |
| üèô land cover | `get_urban_imperv()` |

Currently, `get_traffic()`, and `get_nei_point_summary()` are stashed in
the `/inst` folder and are not integrated into this package.

## Installing Geomarker Data Sources

Installed geomarker data sources and the grf model are hosted as release
assets on GitHub and are downloaded locally to the package-specific R
user data directory (i.e., `tools::R_user_dir("appc", "data")`). These
files are cached across all of an R user‚Äôs sessions and projects.
(Specify an alternative download location by setting the
`R_USER_DATA_DIR` environment variable; see `?tools::R_user_dir`.)

Note that although geomarker data are usually installed *per year*, data
for the current year will always contain missing values for very recent
and future values. To ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù geomarker for the current year, delete
the installed file and reinstall the data; for example:

``` r
file.remove(install_daymet_data("tmmx", "2024"))
install_daymet_data("tmmx", "2024")
```

## Developing

> Please note that the appc project is released with a [Contributor Code
> of Conduct](http://geomarker.io/appc/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html). By
> contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

To create and release the AQS training data, train, and evaluate a
generalized random forest model, install and use
[`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) to execute recipes in the
`justfile`.

To update the MERRA-2 releases:

- Delete any exisiting MERRA-2 data and re-install it using code based
  on `inst/install_merra_from_source_on_cchmc_hpc.sh`
- Create a ‚Äúpre-release‚Äù (i.e., *not latest*) tagged and titled
  `merra-{release_date}` (e.g., `merra-2025-01-02`)
- Update the default release tag used in `get_merra_data()` (and
  `install_merra_data()`)
