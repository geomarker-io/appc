\title{Install daily PM2.5 averages}
\usage{
install_aqs(year = as.character(2025:2017), force_reinstall = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{character; calendar year of data to install}

\item{force_reinstall}{logical; download data from original source instead of reusing older downloads}
}
\value{
a character string path to an AQS data RDS file
}
\description{
Daily data by state is downloaded from the AQS API and filtered/harmonized as
described in the details. Data from the EPA AQS API are updated more frequently compared
to the pre-generated daily average files used by \code{get_daily_aqs()}.
}
\details{
Installing AQS data via the API requires a key associated with an email address.
Signup with the url putting in your email address; e.g.,
https://aqs.epa.gov/data/api/signup?email=my.email.address@emails.com
and look for an email with the key.
Save these credentials as environment variables (or in a \code{.env} file):
\code{AQS_DATA_MART_API_EMAIL} and \code{AQS_DATA_MART_API_KEY}

For PM2.5 (FRM, non-FRM, and speciation), data is filtered to only observations with
a sample duration of "24 HOURS".
All pollutants measurements are removed if the observation percent
for the sampling period is less than 75 or were indicated to be invalid.
When a pollutant is measured by more than one device on the same day at the same
s2 location, the average measurement is returned, ensuring unique measurements for each pollutant-location-day
