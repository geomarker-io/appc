## About

The goal of the appc package is to provide daily, high resolution, near real-time, model-based ambient air pollution exposure assessments.
This is achieved by training a generalized random forest on several geomarkers to predict daily average EPA AQS concentrations from 2017 until the near-present (currently October 2024) at exact locations across the contiguous United States (see `vignette("cv-model-performance")` for more details).

The appc package contains functions for generating geomarker predictors and the ambient air pollution concentrations.
Predictor geomarkers include weather and atmospheric information, wildfire smoke plumes, elevation, and satellite-based aerosol diagnostics products.
Source files included with the package train and evaluate models that can be updated with any release to use more recent AQS measurements and/or geomarker predictors.

## Installing

Install the latest stable release of appc from R-universe with:

```r
install.packages("appc", repos = c("https://geomarker-io.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Install the latest, under-development version of appc from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("geomarker-io/appc")
```

## Example

In R, create model-based predictions of ambient air pollution concentrations at exact locations on specific dates using the `predict_pm25()` function:

```{r}
#| message: true
appc::predict_pm25(
  x = s2::as_s2_cell(c("8841b39a7c46e25f", "8841a45555555555")),
  dates = list(as.Date(c("2025-05-18", "2025-06-10")), as.Date(c("2025-06-22", "2025-09-20")))
)
```

See more examples in `vignette("timeline-example")`.

## S2 Geometry

The [S2Geometry](https://s2geometry.io/) library is a [hierarchical](https://s2geometry.io/devguide/s2cell_hierarchy.html) geospatial index that uses [spherical geometry](https://s2geometry.io/about/overview).
The appc package uses s2 cells via the [s2](https://r-spatial.github.io/s2/) package to specify geospatial locations.
In R, s2 cells can be [created](https://r-spatial.github.io/s2/reference/s2_cell.html#ref-examples) using their character string representation, or by specifying latitude and longitude coordinates; e.g.:

```{r}
s2::s2_lnglat(c(-84.4126, -84.5036), c(39.1582, 39.2875)) |> s2::as_s2_cell()
```

By default, s2 cells are created as "leaf-level cells", which is resolution 30; these cells have areas of about one meter squared.

## Geomarker Assessment

Spatiotemporal geomarkers are used for predicting air pollution concentrations, but also serve as exposures or confounding exposures themselves. View information and options about each geomarker:

| geomarker | appc function |
|-----------|---------------|
| 🌦 weather & atmospheric conditions | `get_gridmet_data()`, `get_narr_data()` |
| 🛰 satellite-based aerosol diagnostics | `get_merra_data()` |
| 🔥 wildfire smoke | `get_hms_smoke_data()` |
| 🗻 elevation | `get_elevation_summary()` |
| 🏙 land cover | `get_nlcd_frac_imperv()` |
| 🚦 traffic | `get_traffic_summary()` |
| 🏭 emissions | `get_nei_point_summary()` |

## Installing Geomarker Data Sources

Installed geomarker data sources and the grf model are hosted as release assets on GitHub and are downloaded locally to the package-specific R user data
directory (i.e., `tools::R_user_dir("appc", "data")`). These files are cached across all of an R user’s sessions and projects. (Specify an alternative download location by setting the `R_USER_DATA_DIR` environment variable; see `?tools::R_user_dir`.)

Note that although geomarker data are usually installed *per year*, data for the current year will always contain missing values for very recent and future values.
To "refresh" geomarker for the current year, delete the installed file and reinstall
the data; for example:

```r
file.remove(install_daymet_data("tmmx", "2025"))
install_daymet_data("tmmx", "2025")
```

## Developing

> Please note that the appc project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](http://geomarker.io/appc/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

To create and release the AQS training data, train, and evaluate a generalized random forest model, install and use [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) to execute recipes in the `justfile`.

To update the MERRA-2 releases:

- Delete any exisiting MERRA-2 data and re-install it using code based on `inst/install_merra_from_source_on_cchmc_hpc.sh`
- Create a "pre-release" (i.e., *not latest*) tagged and titled `merra-{release_date}` (e.g., `merra-2025-01-02`)
- Update the default release tag used in `get_merra_data()`  (and `install_merra_data()`)
